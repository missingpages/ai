    "Representation learning is the process of learning/extracting meaningful representations to make the computations of subsequent ML tasks easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we need good representations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Success of any machine learning method depends on the representation of data. Better the representation, easier for the machine learning algorithm to interpret the data, to produce accurate results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you are asked to write a program, that should return \"True\" if the input no is divisible by 2, otherwise \"False\". Just think how you would write it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if i pass the input no as a \"Roman numeral\" (say XXVIII representing 28) would your program still output correct result?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our programs struggle to interpret the representation and so may fail to give desired results. However if the input is represented as decimal integer, the output would be correct\n",
